 * sometimes you have thousands of SQL queries to run, and you
 * have to schedule them in batches. that is what SQLRunner is for.
 * SQLRunner is a very simple SQL query running scheduler job. It loops
 * over SQL statements supplied by the $data and executes them.
 * not a lot of validation goes on here, so construct queries carefully.
 * one failed query will stop the whole process.
 *
 * be sure you split your queries into manageable batches and feed them to
 * separate jobs, ie. don't overwhelm one job with thousands of queries.

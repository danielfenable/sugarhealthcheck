 * Description: The functionality of the MssqlHelper class has been moved to MssqlManager and
 * SqlsrvManager. This class is no longer used and no code should be added to
 * this file or reference anything in this class. The sole purpose of keeping this class as
 * an empty, deprecated and final class is to cause a conflict when merging functionality or bug fixes
 * from upstream projects. MERGE CONFLICTS should be resolved by inspecting MssqlManager and
 * SqlsrvManager for similar fixes and if none exist by porting the changes from MssqlHelper
 * to either MssqlManager or SqlsrvManager.

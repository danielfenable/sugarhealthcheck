* Description: The functionality of the abstract DBHelper class has been moved to DBManager and
* its database specific derivatives. This class is no longer used and no code should be added
* this file or reference anything in this class. The sole purpose of keeping this class as
* an empty, deprecated and final class is to cause a conflict when merging functionality or bug fixes
* from upstream projects. MERGE CONFLICTS should be resolved by inspecting DBManager and derivatives
* for similar fixes and if none exist by porting the changes from DBHelper to DBManager or its derivatives.
